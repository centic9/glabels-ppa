   The gLabels official distribution is an aggregate of several components.
   Each component is licensed as follows

   The gLabels application core, and other portions of the official gLabels
   distribution not explicitly licensed otherwise, are licensed under
   the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL); either version 2 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version -- see the 'COPYING' file in this
   directory for details.

   The libglabels library, located in the "libglabels/" subdirectory, is
   licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL); either
   version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version -- see
   the 'COPYING-LIBGLABELS' in this directory for details.

   The gLabels and libglabels documentation, located in the "docs/" and "help/"
   subdirectories, is licensed under the GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE (GFDL)
   with no Invariant Sections; either version 1.1 or (at your option) any
   later version -- see 'COPYING-DOCS' in this directory for details.

   The "barcode-0.98/" and "iec16022-0.2.1/" subdirectories contain 3rd party
   libraries, each licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL); either
   version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version -- see the
   'LICENSE' or 'COPYING' file in each of these directories for details.

   The XML files in the "data/templates/" subdirectory constitute the glabels
   label database.  This database is a simple collection of facts so it is
   therefore considered to be public domain and can be used for any purpose.
