Development plan
----------------
This development plan sets a specific set of milestones for future versions
of glabels.


Goals for 2.2.x:

	-  Bugfixes

	-  Translations


Goals for 2.3.x (current development branch for 3.0):

	-  Migrate to Gnome 3.0 platform

	-  Remove deprecations from Gnome 2.0 platform

	-  New color combo selector widget family

	-  New font selector widget family

	-  Undo, Redo capability

	-  Allow for management of custom templates
	   (i.e. delete, rename, edit).

	-  Improve documentation and translation maintainance

	-  Code cleanup


Possible Goals for future branches:

	-  Make text items rich.  I.e. allow multiple characteristics
	   to exist within a single object.  Basically each text object
	   will be a mini word processor.  The bounding box for the object
	   will act like a page, where lines wrap on the word boundary.

	-  Text effects.  (follow contour, non-rectangular text boxes,
	   ...)

	-  Add additional "merge" backends.  Candidates include:
		gnome-db
		internal database stored in glabels file
		generic XML
		freedb (CDDB) for CD labels
		ADIF for generating QSL-cards
		Address books of Thunderbird, Balsa, Claws Mail etc.

	-  Printer calibration tool: a facility for tweaking output
	   origin and scale.  This should really be part of the
	   underlying print system but currently is not, so we may
	   want to add the hack.

	-  Adjustable grid spacing.  Spacing of visible grid should
	   be user adjustable.  This grid spacing should be an
	   integral multiple of a finer invisible grid.  There should
	   be a "snap to grid" toggle, that causes all posistioning
	   and sizing performed on the canvas to snap to the closest
	   grid.  The possible grid spacing should be appropriate
	   for the current units selected (e.g. .1 points, .01 mm,
	   1/64 inch, 0.001 inch).

	-  Ability to select/unselect individual records during a
	   merge-print.

	-  Merge templates which are now in seperate template definitions
	   because the product includes more than one unique shape. This could
	   be done by using tabs in the drawing area.

	-  Ability to define a free-form shape for a label/card. There are some
	   products which have unusual shapes. This includes free-form markup
	   objects. For the time being, the ability to concatenate a shape from
	   other basic shapes could be sufficient here.

	-  See https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=445119&group_id=46122&func=browse
	   for additional ideas.
