    <title>Example 1: Name Tags</title>

      <p>In this example we are organizing an orientation party for the new
        crew members of our ship.  We have a list of freshman crew members that we
        created in <app>gnumeric</app> and exported as the following
        CSV file.  We could have created this file by using a text editor, but heck it
        is the 23rd century.</p>

      <code>
Name,Department,SN
"Jim Kirk",Management,"SC937-0176 CEC"
"Mr. Spock",Sciences,S179-276SP
"Leonard McCoy",Medicine,unknown
"Montgomery Scott",Engineering,SE-197-54T
      </code>

      <p>In <app>gLabels</app> we have created a new <app>glabels</app>
        document using the Avery 5395 "Name Badge Labels" template.  Next we use the
        <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui>
        <gui>Merge Properties</gui> </guiseq> menu item to display
        the <gui>merge properties</gui> dialog.  We use this dialog to
        select the source type (in our case CSV with keys on line 1) and the merge
	source (filename) as shown.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex1-1.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Merge properties dialog</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>We can also view each record in more detail by clicking on the appropriate
        expander (the little triangles) as shown.  Once we are satisfied with the
        selections in this dialog we click <gui>OK</gui> to accept the
        changes.</p>

      <p>Now we start adding objects to our <app>glabels</app> document as shown.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex1-2.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Adding objects</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>In this example we have added three text objects and a barcode object.  The
        first text object contains only simple literal text ("Hello, my name is").  The
        second text object contains a single merge field ("${Name}") corresponding to the
        first field of a record (first column of a line) which contains the new crew
        member's full name.  The third text field contains both literal text
        ("Department: ") followed by a single merge field ("${Department}") corresponding to
        the second field or the crew member's department.  The barcode object is
        configured to use field (or key) "SN" which contains our crew member's
        starfleet serial number.</p>

      <p>Now we can print our name tags by selecting the
        <guiseq> <gui>File</gui>
        <gui>Print</gui> </guiseq> menu item.  This will display
        print dialog as shown below.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex1-3.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Printing name tags</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>Just to make sure our labels are going to look okay, we select the
        <gui>Print outlines</gui> option and click
        <gui>Print Preview</gui>.  This will display a print preview dialog
        as shown below.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex1-4.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Name tags preview</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>Everything looks good, so we can now load up our printer with
        the appropriate label stock, print our name tags and start beaming our guests
        aboard.</p>
