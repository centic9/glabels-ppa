    <title>To print labels and cards</title>

      <p>To print labels or cards, choose
        <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Print</gui>
	</guiseq> to display the <gui>Print</gui> dialog.
        Once print options have been selected, click <gui>Print</gui>
        to print the labels or cards.  To simply preview the results,
        click <gui>Print Preview</gui> instead.</p>

      <p>The <gui>Print</gui> dialog allows you to specify the
        following print options:</p>

      <section>
	<title>The Labels Tab of the Print Dialog</title>

	<section>
            <title>Print control (Simple)</title>

	      <p>For simple labels or cards (no document merge), the job
                tabbed section contains the following copy controls.</p>

	      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/print-copies.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Print Copy Controls</p>
    		</media>
	      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

	      <p>The number of copies of the label can be selected by
                choosing the number of full sheets to print, or a specific
                subset of labels on a single sheet.</p>

	      <p>The mini-preview can also be used to graphically select
                the subset of labels by clicking the first label on the
                mini-preview and dragging to the last label.</p>

	  </section>

	  <section>
            <title>Print control (Merge)</title>

	      <p>For labels or cards using the document merge (also known
                as "mail merge") capability, the job tabbed section contains
                the following merge controls instead of copy controls.</p>

	      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/print-merge.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Print Document Merge Controls</p>
    		</media>
	      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

	      <p>The total number of labels or cards printed is the
                product of the number of records in the merge source and
                the number of copies selected.  If multiple copies are
                selected, these can be either collated (copies of the
                same record grouped together) or un-collated (one copy
                each record is printed before next copy).</p>

	      <p>Printing can begin on any label on the first sheet.
                This can be selected with the <gui>Start on
                label</gui> spinbutton.</p>

	      <p>The mini-preview can also be used to graphically select
                this first label, by clicking on the desired label in the
                mini-preview.</p>

	  <section> 
	  <title>Options</title>
	      <p>The following options can also be selected.</p>
	      <list>
		<item>
		  <p><gui>print outlines</gui></p>
		  <p>Print outlines of labels.  This option is useful for
                    dry-runs, to test printer alignment.</p>
		</item>
		<item>
		  <p><gui>print in reverse</gui></p>
		  <p>Prints the labels as mirror images.  This option is
                    useful for printing on clear labels that will be viewed
                    from the reverse side (e.g. in a car window).</p>
		</item>
		<item>
		  <p><gui>print crop marks</gui></p>
		  <p>Prints crop marks along the edge of the sheet.
                    This option is useful for printing on blank stock, to
                    be cut after printing.  This option does not work well
                    with all templates.</p>
