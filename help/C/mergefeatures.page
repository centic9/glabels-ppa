    <title>Performing a document merge</title>

      <p>Document Merge (sometimes called "Mail Merge") is a powerful
        feature that allows a unique label or card to be printed for each
        record in an external data source.</p>

      <p>The first step to performing a document merge is to prepare
        a source document that contains your merge data.  This data could
        be mailing addresses or any other data that you wish to create
        unique labels or cards for.  Currently back-ends only exist for
        text files and the evolution data server -- others are planned.  The currently
        supported text-file format is very simple:  each line is a record;
        fields are delimited by commas (CSV), tabs, or colons; and newlines
        can be embedded into fields by using the "\n" entity.  This file
        could be created using any text editor or could be created by
        another program or script.  A common way of creating CSV files is
	to export them from a spreadsheet program or from address book
	applications.</p>
	
	<note style="advanced">
         <p>
         To export a CSV file from <app>kaddressbook</app>, first select the
	 contacts you wish to export. Click on the first contact, then press and
	 hold <key>Ctrl</key> and click on the other desired contacts to select them.
	 Then choose <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Export</gui>
	 <gui>Export CSV File</gui></guiseq>.</p>
	 
	 <p>
	 In the <gui>Select Contacts</gui>
	 window, enable the button <gui>Selected contacts</gui> (which should be
	 enabled by default anyway). Then click on <gui>OK</gui>.
	 In the <gui>Save As</gui> dialog, choose the desired folder and a name
	 for the file and click on <gui>Save</gui>.
         </p>
        </note>
	
	<note style="advanced">
         <p>
	 To export a CSV file from <app>Thunderbird</app>, click on the
	 <gui>Address Book</gui> toolbar button or choose <guiseq><gui>Tools
	 </gui><gui>Address Book</gui></guiseq> from the menu.
	 Then select the contacts you wish to export. Click on the first contact,
	 then press and hold <key>Ctrl</key> and click on the other desired contacts
	 to select them. Then choose <guiseq><gui>Tools</gui><gui>Export</gui>
	 </guiseq>.</p>
	 
	 <p>
	 In the file chooser window, choose the desired folder and a name
	 for the file and change the value of the drop-down button in the
	 right bottom corner to <gui>Comma Separated</gui>. Finally, click on
	 <gui>Save</gui>.
         </p>
        </note>

      <p>A label must then be configured to "point at" this data file.
        To configure the merge properties of a document, choose
        <guiseq><gui>Objects</gui>
        <gui>Merge Properties</gui></guiseq> menu item
        to display the <gui>merge properties</gui> dialog.  This
        dialog is used to select the exact data file format and file
        name (location) of the merge data.</p>

      <p>Finally, once the label has been configured for a data file,
        field keys can be inserted into text objects and used as source
        or data for barcode objects and image filenames for image objects.
        See <link xref="editprop" /> for more information
        on using merge data for these object types.</p>

      <p>Now that your label is configured, <app>gLabels</app> will print a unique
        label for each record in your source document -- substituting fields
        from each record for field keys in the all text, barcode, and
        image objects.</p>

      <p>See <link xref="merge" /> for a detailed
        tutorial on the document merge feature.</p>
