  <title>Skipping blank address lines</title>

  <p>This feature can be best described by a simple example.  In the
  following CSV file, column 5 (ADDR2) contains the second address line
  for each record.  This field is empty in records 1 and 2, but not in
  record 3. (For this feature to work, the field must be completely
  empty -- any text, including spaces will defeat this feature.)</p>

  <code>
  LAST,FIRST,MI,ADDR1,ADDR2,CITY,STATE,ZIP
  Summers,Joyce,,"1630 Revello Dr",,Sunnydale,CA,95037
  McGarret,Steve,O,"404 Piikoi Street",,Honolulu,HI,96813
  Kramer,Cosmo,,"Apt 5B","129 W. 81 St.","New York",NY,10024-7207
  </code>

  <p>In the following screenshot, a single multiline text object has been
  created to format these addresses.  Notice that ${ADDR2} representing
  the second address line is on a line by itself.  (Any additional text
  on this line, including spaces would defeat this feature.)</p>

  <p>Multi-line address</p>
  </media>

  <p>Printing this label results in the following output.  Notice that the
  line containing the ${ADDR2} field is completely skipped for the first
  two records, without printing a blank line.</p>
