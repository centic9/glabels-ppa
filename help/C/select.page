    <title>To select objects</title>

      <p>A prerequisite for performing operations on objects is the
        selection of individual objects or groups of objects.  The
        display area must be in the object selection mode to create new
        selections, as indicated by an arrow cursor.  The object
        selection mode is selected by the
        <guiseq><gui>Objects</gui>
        <gui>Select Mode</gui></guiseq> menu item,
        or the corresponding command on the <gui>Drawing
        Toolbar</gui>.</p>

      <section>
	  <title>Selecting a single object</title>
	    <p>A single object can be selected simply by clicking
             on the desired object in the display area.
             Once selected the object will be highlighted with a set of
             resizing handles.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>Aggregate object selections</title>
	    <p>Multiple objects can be selected by first selecting the first
              object as above and then by holding the <key>Ctrl</key>
              key while selecting additional objects.
              Individual objects can be added to an existing selection
              at any time by holding the <key>Ctrl</key> key while
              selecting the desired objects.  All objects can also be
              selected by using the <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui>
              <gui>Select All</gui></guiseq>
              menu item.  All objects in an aggregate object selection will be
              highlighted.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>Area selections</title>
	  
	    <p>Multiple objects can also be selected by clicking an empty
              area and dragging to form a rectangular area.  When released,
              all objects contained in the area will form an aggregate
              selection.  An area selection can be used to add to an existing
              selection by holding the <key>Ctrl</key> key while
              performing the selection.</p>
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>Unselecting objects</title>
	  
	    <p>Individual objects can be removed from an existing
              selection by holding the <key>Ctrl</key> key while
              clicking on a previously selected object.  An entire selection
              can be dismissed by using the <guiseq>
	      <gui>Edit</gui> <gui>Un-select All</gui>
              </guiseq> menu item
              or by simply clicking any empty space in the display area.
              Once an object is unselected its highlight is removed.</p>
