    <title>Example 2: Address labels</title>

      <p>In this example we are going to throw a party and need to print mailing
        address labels for our invitations.  We have a list of our closest friends
        that we created in <app>gnumeric</app> and exported as the
        following CSV file.  It should be noted that not everyone has a middle initial or
        a two line address.</p>

      <code>
LAST,FIRST,MI,ADDR1,ADDR2,CITY,STATE,ZIP
,,,,,,,
Critter,Ess,S,"123 Faux St.",,Alexandria,VA,22310
Doe,John,,"Apt 1X","451 Mystery St.",Trenton,NJ,08601
Summers,Joyce,,"1630 Revello Dr",,Sunnydale,CA,95037
McGarret,Steve,O,"404 Piikoi Street",,Honolulu,HI,96813
Kramer,Cosmo,,"Apt 5B","129 W. 81 St.","New York",NY,10024-7207
      </code>

      <p>In <app>glabels</app> we have created a new <app>glabels</app>
        document using the Avery 5512 "Address Labels" template.  Next we use the
        <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui>
        <gui>Merge Properties</gui> </guiseq> menu item to display
        the <gui>merge properties</gui> dialog.  We use this dialog to
        select the source type (in our case CSV with keys on line 1) and the merge
	source (filename) as shown.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->

      		<p>Merge properties dialog</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>Before applying the merge source, we uncheck the first record since it only
        contains empty fields.  It is an artifact of our original <app>gnumeric</app> spreadsheet
        and would simply waste our first label.  We could also unselect
        any other records that we didn't want to print a label for.</p>

      <p>We can also view each record in more detail by clicking on the appropriate
        expander (the little triangles) as shown.  Once we are satisfied with the
        selections in this dialog we click <gui>OK</gui> to accept the
        changes.</p>

      <p>Now we start adding objects to our <app>glabels</app> document as shown.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex2-2.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Adding objects</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>In this example we have a single text object.  This text object contains
        all of our merge fields organized on multiple lines as a mailing address.
        Notice that fields ${ADDR1} and ${ADDR2} are each
        located with no other text on their own lines.  When
        <app>glabels</app> encounters a field as the only text on
        a line, it will not expand the line if the field is empty.</p>

      <p>Now we can print our address labels by selecting the
        <guiseq> <gui>File</gui>
        <gui>Print</gui> </guiseq> menu item.  This will display
        print dialog as shown below.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex2-3.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Printing address labels</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>Just to make sure our labels are going to look okay, we select the
        <gui>Print outlines</gui> option and click
        <gui>Print Preview</gui>.  This will display a print preview dialog
        as shown below.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
		<media type="image" src="figures/merge-ex2-4.png" mime="image/png" style="right">
      		<p>Address labels preview</p>
    		</media>
      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>Everything looks good, so we can now load up our printer with
        the appropriate label stock, print our address labels and start mailing
        our party invitations.</p>
