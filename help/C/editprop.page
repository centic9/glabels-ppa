    <title>To edit object properties</title>

    <section id="glabels-object-properties">

      <p>Most object properties can be modified through the object
        editor sidebar, illustrated below.  To use the object editor,
        a single object must first be selected.  See
        <link xref="select" />.</p>

      <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->

      <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->

      <p>The object editor will contain a subset of the following
        tabbed sections, depending on object type:</p>

      <section id="object-editor-text">
	<title>Text Tabbed Section (Text objects)</title>

	<p>This section contains a small editor for changing the content
          of a text object.  It also contains a dropdown menu of available
          document merge keys, that can be inserted into text.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="object-editor-image">
	<title>Image Tabbed Section (Image objects)</title>

	<p>This section contains a file entry with preview to select
          image files.  The browse button can be used to easily locate
          image files.  Alternatively, a document merge key can be used
          instead to provide a filename at print time.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="object-editor-data">
	<title>Data Tabbed Section (Barcode objects)</title>

	<p>This section contains a text entry to enter literal barcode
          data.  Alternatively, a document merge key can be used to
          provide this data at print time.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="object-editor-style">
	<title>Style Tabbed Section (Text objects)</title>

	<p>This section contains controls to select text properties,
          including font family, font size, font weight, color, and
          text justification.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="object-editor-barcode">
	<title>Style Tabbed Section (Barcode objects)</title>

	<p>This section contains controls to select barcode properties,
          including barcode style, color, whether to print text, and whether
          to include a checksum digit.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="object-editor-line">
	<title>Line Tabbed Section</title>

	<p>This section contains controls to select properties of lines
          and outlines.  These properties include line width and color.</p>

          and ellipse objects.  Currently the only fill property is fill
          color.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="object-editor-size">
	<title>Size Tabbed Section (All except line objects)</title>

	<p>This section contains controls to select the width and height
          of an object.  A checkbox is provided, so that the current aspect
          ratio can be locked while manipulating the width and height controls.
          Image objects also provide a button to reset the size to the
          image's natural size (Assumes 72DPI).</p>

          object.</p>

<!-- ============= Other Manipulations of Objects ========= -->
    <section id="glabels-object-manipulation"> 
      <title>Other Manipulations of Objects</title>

      <p>Objects can also be manipulated in the following ways.</p>

      <section id="other-moving-resizing">
	<title>Moving and Resizing Objects</title>

	<p>Objects can be moved by simply clicking on a selected
          object and dragging the object to its new location.  If the object
          is part of an aggregate selection, all objects in the selection
          will move with the object being dragged, maintaining their relative
          positions to one another.  If no object is selected, clicking on
          an object will create a new selection containing that object.
          See <link xref="select" />.</p>

	<p>A selected object can be resized by clicking one of its resize
          handle and dragging it to obtain the new size.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="other-stacking-order">
	<title>Changing Stacking Order</title>

	<p>Stacking order refers to relative position in the z-axis of
          objects.  That is when objects overlap, which object will appear
          on top of the other.  By default, newer objects will appear above
          older objects.  To change this order, select one or more objects
          and choose <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui>
          <gui>Order</gui>
          <gui>Bring to Front</gui> </guiseq>
          to raise the selection to the top of the stacking
          order, or choose <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui>
          <gui>Order</gui>
          <gui>Send to Back</gui> </guiseq>
          to lower the selection to the bottom of the
          stacking order.  These menuitems are also available by right-clicking
          the display area when there is a non-empty selection.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="other-rotating-flipping">
	<title>Rotating and Flipping Objects</title>

	<p>Objects can be rotated 90 degrees in either direction, or flipped
          horizontally or vertically, by choosing the appropriate menuitem
          in the  <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui>
          <gui>Rotate/Flip</gui> </guiseq> sub-menu.  These
          menuitems are also available by right-clicking
          the display area when there is a non-empty selection.</p>

         <note>
         <p>
	  This feature could be useful when you are designing CD box inlays. For 
          the spine caption, you need vertical aligned text. After you have created
          a basic text box, choose <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui><gui>Rotate/Flip</gui> </guiseq>
          to rotate the text box according to your needs.
         </p>
         </note>

      </section>

      <section id="other-alignment">
	<title>Aligning Objects</title>

	<p>Objects can be aligned horizontally or vertically, relative to
          one another, or relative to the center line of the label, by
          choosing the appropriate menuitem from the  <guiseq>
          <gui>Objects</gui>
          <gui>Align Horizontal</gui>
          </guiseq> or  <guiseq> <gui>Objects</gui>
          <gui>Align Vertical</gui> </guiseq> sub-menus.
          These menuitems are also available by right-clicking
          the display area when there is a non-empty selection.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="other-property-bar">
	<title>Using the Property Bar</title>

	<p>The property bar can be used to change some common properties
          of objects en-masse.  These properties include font family, font
          size, font weight, text alignment, text color, fill color, line
          or outline color, and line width.  The property bar also controls
          the defaults for these properties for any newly created objects.
          </p>
